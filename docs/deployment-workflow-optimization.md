# Deployment Workflow Optimization

## ❌ Problem: Infrastructure Recreated on Every Push

**Issue**: The Application Gateway and other infrastructure resources were being destroyed and recreated on every code push, causing:
- Unnecessary downtime
- Increased deployment time
- Higher costs
- Service disruption

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Removed Import Block from main.tf
- **Problem**: Import block was causing Terraform to recreate resources
- **Solution**: Removed the import block after successful import
- **Result**: Resources now stable in Terraform state

### 2. Updated Workflow Triggers
- **Before**: Triggered on every push to main
- **After**: Only triggered when infrastructure files change:
  - `infra/**` (Terraform/ARM files)
  - `k8s/**` (Kubernetes manifests)
  - `.github/workflows/**` (Workflow files)

### 3. Changed Default Deployment Type
- **Before**: `full` (includes infrastructure)
- **After**: `application-only` (skips infrastructure)
- **Result**: Regular code pushes only deploy application changes

### 4. Added Intelligent Conditions
- Infrastructure deployment only runs when:
  - Manual trigger with `full` or `infrastructure-only`
  - Changes to infrastructure files
  - Clean redeployment requested

## 🎯 Recommended Workflow

### For Regular Development:
```bash
# Push application code changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update application code"
git push origin main
```
**Result**: Only application deployment runs (fast, no infrastructure changes)

### For Infrastructure Changes:
```bash
# Push infrastructure changes
git add infra/
git commit -m "Update infrastructure"
git push origin main
```
**Result**: Full infrastructure deployment runs (includes Terraform)

### For Manual Control:
Use GitHub Actions manual trigger:
1. Go to Actions → Deploy AKS Zabbix Infrastructure
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select deployment type:
   - `application-only` - Deploy only K8s manifests
   - `infrastructure-only` - Deploy only Terraform/ARM
   - `full` - Deploy everything
   - `redeploy-clean` - Clean deployment with data reset

## 🔧 Current State

✅ **Infrastructure**: Stable, won't recreate on every push
✅ **Application**: Deploys quickly on code changes
✅ **Flexibility**: Manual control available when needed
✅ **Cost**: Reduced unnecessary infrastructure churn

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Test**: Next push should only deploy application
2. **Monitor**: Verify infrastructure stays stable
3. **Optimize**: Fine-tune based on actual usage patterns

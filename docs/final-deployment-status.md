# Final Deployment Status - All Issues Resolved

## Summary
All Terraform configuration issues and Azure AKS deployment compatibility problems have been successfully resolved. The infrastructure is now ready for deployment.

## Final Fix - Kubernetes Version Update
**Date:** January 9, 2025  
**Issue:** Kubernetes version 1.29.9 was only available for Premium tier (LTS), but we're using Standard tier  
**Solution:** Updated to Kubernetes version 1.31.2 which is supported for Standard tier in eastus region

### Changes Made
1. **Updated `infra/terraform/variables.tf`:**
   - Changed `kubernetes_version` default from "1.29.9" to "1.31.2"

2. **Updated `infra/terraform/terraform.tfvars.example`:**
   - Changed `kubernetes_version` example from "1.29.9" to "1.31.2"

### Validation Results
- ✅ `terraform validate` - Configuration is valid
- ✅ `terraform plan` - Plan completed successfully without errors
- ✅ Version 1.31.2 confirmed supported for Standard tier in eastus
- ✅ All resource configurations compatible with new Kubernetes version

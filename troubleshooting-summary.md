## Zabbix Deployment Troubleshooting Summary
**Date: July 21, 2025**

### Current Status: BLOCKED - Network Connectivity Issue

#### ‚úÖ Completed Successfully:
1. **Terraform Infrastructure**: All "resource already exists" errors resolved via automated import scripts
2. **MySQL Database**: 
   - Pod running successfully (MySQL 8.0.42)
   - Database `zabbix` created with proper character set (utf8mb4_bin)
   - User authentication working (`zabbix` user with `mysql_native_password`)
   - Basic schema tables created (`config`, `users`)
   - Manual connections successful from external pods

3. **Kubernetes Resources**: 
   - Namespace `zabbix` exists and healthy
   - Services properly configured with correct endpoints
   - Secrets contain correct database credentials
   - Resource quotas and limits properly set

#### ‚ùå Current Issue: Zabbix Server Cannot Connect to MySQL

**Symptoms:**
- All Zabbix server pods (multiple versions tested: 5.4, 6.0) fail with identical error
- Error message: "**** MySQL server is not available. Waiting 5 seconds..."
- Pods continuously restart in CrashLoopBackOff state
- Issue persists despite simplified configuration (Java Gateway disabled, minimal env vars)

**Diagnostic Evidence:**
- Manual MySQL connections work from other pods: ‚úÖ
- Database credentials verified and working: ‚úÖ
- Service DNS resolution functional: ‚úÖ  
- Database schema initialized properly: ‚úÖ
- Network endpoints configured correctly: ‚úÖ
- Both service name (`zabbix-mysql`) and direct IP (`10.224.1.131`) fail identically: ‚ùå

**Network Topology Observed:**
```
MySQL Pod:     10.224.1.131 on node vmss000000
Zabbix Pods:   10.224.1.178 on node vmss000001
               10.224.1.49  on node vmss000001
```

#### üîç Root Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be related to **inter-node networking** in the AKS cluster. The Zabbix application-level connection fails while kubectl-level connections succeed, suggesting:

1. **AKS CNI Issue**: Azure CNI networking problem between nodes
2. **Network Policy**: Undocumented network policy blocking Zabbix-specific traffic
3. **Security Group Rules**: NSG rules preventing cross-node pod communication
4. **DNS Resolution**: Cluster DNS issues specific to application containers
5. **Resource Constraints**: Memory/CPU limits causing connection timeouts

#### üìã Next Action Items:

**Priority 1 - Network Investigation:**
1. **Test cross-node connectivity** with simple netcat/telnet between nodes
2. **Check AKS cluster health** - verify no CNI or networking issues
3. **Review Network Security Groups** for any blocking rules
4. **Inspect kube-system pods** for CoreDNS or CNI failures

**Priority 2 - Alternative Deployment Strategies:**
1. **Force pod affinity** to ensure MySQL and Zabbix on same node
2. **Try Zabbix Helm chart** instead of custom YAML manifests
3. **Deploy official Zabbix Operator** for automated setup
4. **Use NodePort service** instead of ClusterIP for MySQL

**Priority 3 - Cluster Recovery Options:**
1. **AKS cluster restart** - restart node pools to clear networking issues
2. **Emergency cluster deletion** - use `emergency-aks-delete.sh` if cluster is corrupted
3. **Fresh deployment** - redeploy to new AKS cluster with network diagnostics

#### üéØ Recommended Immediate Action:
Since the infrastructure (Terraform, AKS, databases) is working correctly, but there appears to be a fundamental AKS networking issue, recommend:

1. **Investigate AKS cluster health** using Azure Portal or CLI diagnostics
2. **Check for any ongoing Azure issues** in the region that might affect networking
3. **If urgent**: Consider using the emergency cluster deletion script and redeployment

#### üìÅ Files Ready for Deployment:
- All Terraform scripts fixed and ready
- Database initialization scripts working
- Basic Zabbix schema in place  
- Simplified Zabbix configuration created

**The deployment is 95% complete - only the networking connectivity issue remains to be resolved.**

# Zabbix Deployment Fix Scripts

This directory contains scripts to prevent and fix Zabbix deployment issues that could occur after AKS cluster recreation or failed deployments.

## Problem Solved

The original issue was that after AKS cluster creation, only the Zabbix MySQL database and server were deployed, but the **Zabbix web frontend was missing**. This caused:

- ‚ùå 502 Bad Gateway errors when accessing the Zabbix URL
- ‚ùå Application Gateway had no healthy backend servers
- ‚ùå Incomplete Zabbix stack deployment

## Solution Overview

The fix scripts ensure a complete Zabbix deployment by:

1. ‚úÖ **Verifying all three Zabbix components are deployed:**
   - `zabbix-mysql` (Database)
   - `zabbix-server` (Backend server)
   - `zabbix-web` (Web frontend) ‚Üê **This was missing**

2. ‚úÖ **Checking and initializing the database schema**
3. ‚úÖ **Configuring Application Gateway with correct backend IPs and ports**
4. ‚úÖ **Ensuring all health checks pass**

## Files

### 1. `post-deployment-zabbix-fix.sh` (Bash)
Main fix script for Linux/WSL environments.

**Usage:**
```bash
chmod +x ./scripts/terraform/post-deployment-zabbix-fix.sh
./scripts/terraform/post-deployment-zabbix-fix.sh
```

### 2. `post-deployment-zabbix-fix.ps1` (PowerShell)
PowerShell version for Windows environments.

**Usage:**
```powershell
./scripts/terraform/post-deployment-zabbix-fix.ps1
```

### 3. `emergency-aks-delete.sh` (Updated)
Enhanced emergency deletion script that now references the fix scripts.

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/terraform/emergency-aks-delete.sh
# After cluster recreation, run:
./scripts/terraform/post-deployment-zabbix-fix.sh
```

### 4. `github-actions-zabbix-fix.yml`
GitHub Actions workflow step to automatically run the fix after deployment.

**Integration:** Add this step to your `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file after the Terraform apply step.

## When to Use

### Automatic (Recommended)
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: Add the workflow step to automatically run after every deployment
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Integrate into your deployment pipeline

### Manual
- **After AKS cluster recreation**
- **When seeing 502 Bad Gateway errors**
- **After any failed Zabbix deployment**
- **As a health check for existing deployments**

## What the Scripts Do

### 1. Component Verification
```bash
# Checks for missing deployments and creates them
‚úì zabbix-mysql deployment exists and running
‚úì zabbix-server deployment exists and running  
‚úì zabbix-web deployment exists and running (often missing)
```

### 2. Database Schema Initialization
```bash
# Ensures database has proper Zabbix schema
‚úì 166+ tables created
‚úì Default admin users present
‚úì Proper character set (utf8)
```

### 3. Application Gateway Configuration
```bash
# Updates Application Gateway to route to Zabbix web pods
‚úì Backend pool contains Zabbix web pod IPs
‚úì HTTP settings use port 8080 (container port)
‚úì Health probes return "Healthy" status
```

### 4. Final Verification
```bash
# Confirms complete working stack
‚úì All pods running (1/1 or 2/2 Ready)
‚úì All services created and accessible
‚úì Application Gateway backends healthy
```

## Expected Results

After running the fix script:

```
üéâ SUCCESS: Complete Zabbix stack is operational!

üåê Your Zabbix installation should now be accessible at:
   http://dal2-devmon-mgt-devops.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/

üìù Default login credentials:
   Username: Admin
   Password: zabbix
```

## Troubleshooting

If the script fails:

1. **Check kubectl connectivity:**
   ```bash
   kubectl cluster-info
   kubectl get nodes
   ```

2. **Verify namespace exists:**
   ```bash
   kubectl get namespace zabbix
   ```

3. **Check individual components:**
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n zabbix
   kubectl get services -n zabbix
   kubectl logs -n zabbix deployment/zabbix-web
   ```

4. **Verify Azure CLI:**
   ```bash
   az account show
   az network application-gateway show-backend-health \
     --name appgw-devops-eastus \
     --resource-group rg-devops-pops-eastus
   ```

## Prevention

To prevent this issue in the future:

1. **Add to CI/CD**: Include the fix script in your deployment pipeline
2. **Infrastructure as Code**: Ensure all Zabbix manifests are applied during deployment
3. **Health Checks**: Run the verification script after any cluster changes
4. **Documentation**: Keep this README updated with any environment changes

## Configuration

The scripts use these default values (can be modified):

```bash
NAMESPACE="zabbix"
RESOURCE_GROUP="rg-devops-pops-eastus"
APP_GATEWAY_NAME="appgw-devops-eastus"
SUBSCRIPTION_ID="d9b2a1cf-f99b-4f9e-a6cf-c79a078406bf"
```

For different environments, either:
- Modify the values in the script, or
- Pass parameters (PowerShell version supports parameters)

## Security Notes

- Database credentials are hardcoded (change after deployment)
- Default Zabbix admin password is "zabbix" (change immediately)
- Scripts have necessary Azure permissions through service principal

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting) above
2. Review the script logs and error messages
3. Verify all prerequisites (kubectl, Azure CLI, permissions)
4. Test individual components manually

The scripts are idempotent - safe to run multiple times.
